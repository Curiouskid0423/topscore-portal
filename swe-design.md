*   Component relationship (e.g. **`Higher-order Components`**)
*   Project structure (what files inherit what)
*   Be careful with mobile compatibility
*   Where will data come from

### A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Functionalities
<br>

#### Front-end
Sketch the components on a piece of paper for each webpage / UI.
- Pages & File hierarchy
- Functionality of each webpage (page-flow of user experience)
- Components 
    - Reusable components are marked with `R` tags.
    - Template components are marked with `T` tags.
- Data in a centralized Redux store

#### Backend 
- Database Structure
    - How many separated databases? What info should be nested within a column?

2. ##### Home (Greeting) Page
    - `<Topbar />`
    - `<Sidebar />`
